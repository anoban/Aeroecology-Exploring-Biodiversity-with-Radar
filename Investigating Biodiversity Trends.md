# ___Investigating Biodiversity Trends___
---------------------

## ___Biodiversity___

___"The variability among living organisms from all sources, including inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part: this includes diversity within and between species and, of ecosystems"___

___There is a growing body of strong evidences, confirming the decline of species in abundance and diversity across a wide range of locations.___

___When we try to bring all these information together, the picture gets far more complicated.___          

- In some places species might be increasing while in other places they might be decreasing.      
    
- A species might be declining in one habitat and proliferating in another habitat.


___The result of this is, a heterogeneity in trends, this happens because nature is inherently complex. Adding to this is the shortcomings of the methodologies we use to study the natural world.___

___Consider the following techniques used to study animal populations.___

___They all capture a small subset of features of the local animal community.___

___None of them are holistic and fail to provide a complete and comprehensive view of the local ecosystem dynamics. So, generally we are only able to gather information on a small number of features of a small subset of the intended animal population / community.___

- A pan trap collecting pollinators - how big should your pan trap be?
- How long should one sweep a butterfly net?
- How big and deep should be your pitfall traps be?

___Ecologists struggle to standardize the data collection processes, and consequently end up with highly heterogenous incoherent bodies of information.___

___There are other challenges in biodiversity too.___

- Most of the biodiversity is found in tropical and subtropical nations. These nations generally tend to be developing countries where the resources and funding for biodiversity research is generally scarce. On the contrary, developed nations in the temperate regions may have more resources and fundings but less diverse ecosystems.

- In addition to the above geographic bias, we also have taxonomic bias. Taxonomically speaking, insects are the largest and most diverse among all animals. Despite this, most biodiversity data comes from birds. This bias arises from "citizen scientists" and professional researchers likewise preferring attractive / interesting creatures (birds) while neglecting the less attractive  or harder to study ones.

- Insect ecology is plagued with cryptic diversity. It becomes very hard to distinguish one species from another. And these identification issues compound when one is dealing on a ecosystems scale where he/she has to consider the ecosystem dynamics and interactions between species & abiotic environment.

___It is hard to predict how much biodiversity an ecological network can loose before it collapses. (quantifying ecosystem resiliency).___

___Even if we manage to identify the drivers of biodiversity decline, it is quite hard to determine how they drive this process. When we think about managed bee populations (in a bee farm) there might be pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, invasive species, land use change, loss of natural floral resources, diseases and pathogens that all have the potential to independently affect bees. These causes may have more grave impacts when paired with one another.___
