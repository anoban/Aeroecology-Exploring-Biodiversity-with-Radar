# ___What Biodiversity can Radars not Visualize?___
---------------

- ___Radars, as you may know, are not all-seeing technologies.___        

- ___Weather radars work very well with large number of organisms, but there's a threshold below which the presence of objects aren't dense enough to reflect the radar beams back to the receiver. This means that small number of organisms (meaning small groups) or small organisms are essentially invisible to weather radars.___

- ___Weather radars cannot be used to track the first pest insect to arrive in a field.___

- ___Weather radars are designed to look up, since the atmospheric components suggestive of weather are at higher altitudes. This scanning height, in association with blindspots created by ground clutter e.g. (tall trees, hills, mountains & skycrapers) make the measurement of viable & useful data to start at 200 - 300 meters altitude. This makes it quite difficult to study what's happening close to the ground.___

- ___In addition to issues regarding abundance, there are still no clear strategies to understand how much taxonomic resolution weather radars can generate. In other words, we cannot trust that weather radars can distinguish between a locust, butterfly & a dragonfly.___

- ___Distribution of weather radars impose many barriers to their wider usage. Locust swarms have been spotted in weather radars since the 1950s. But the current global weather radar network is simply not in the most tactical locations to learn more about these destructive pest epidemics. e.g East Africa___

- ___VLRs remedy many of the aforementioned shortcomings but come with their own set of issues. They can detect individuals, but limited by the size of the individuals. An aphid of 5 - 10 mg will only be detectable in the most powerful range of the radar beam, close to the transmitter and close to the ground.___

- ___VLRs are also very limited in what they can scan. The details within their scan space is excellent but to make good sense of those details one needs a good grasp of what's happeining in the vicinity (outside) of the scan space, a cause that cannot be helped by the VLRs.___

- ___Consequently, researchers choose a location for VLRs that can give allow them to make representative samples of the local biodiversity. Even with the fine resolution of the small concentrated scope of VLRs, it is still unclear how much taxonomic resolution the VLRs, bird and insect radars bring to the table.___
