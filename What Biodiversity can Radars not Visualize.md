# ___What Biodiversity can Radars not Visualize?___
---------------

### ___Radars, as you may know, are not all-seeing technologies.___

### ___Weather radars work very well with large number of organisms, but there's a threshold below which the presence of objects aren't dense enough to reflect the radar beams back to the receiver. This means that small number of organisms (meaning small groups) or small organisms are essentially invisible to weather radars.___

### ___Weather radars cannot be used to track the first pest insect to arrive in a field.___

### ___Weather radars are designed to look up, since the atmospheric components suggestive of weather are at higher altitudes. This scanning height, in association with blindspots created by ground clutter e.g. (tall trees, hills, mountains, skycrapers) make the measurement of viable & useful data to start at 200 - 300 meters altitude.___
