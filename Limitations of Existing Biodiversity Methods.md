### ___Underwater drones___

___Underwater drones can be used to monitor and survey a wide range of species in the marine environment.____   

___However, the results can be expected to be more accurate when used to survey sedentary marine organisms like algae, kelps, sponges, corals,
or slow moving fishes, molluscs, crustaceans - prawns, crabs, sea snails, puffer fishes etc... Because their speed could be a real limitation. 
If one is to study a highly motile fish species, will these drones be able to identify them, let alone characterize them? consider a bluefin tuna, a great white shark or a swordfish? Can these drones keep their pace with them to make certain measurements like length, color, sex ..etc. What are the chances that these might be attacked when exposed to aggressive predators? Consider these drones coming into contact with sharks, killer whales or any other aggressive marine animal? And how deep can these drones dive to do the surveys? How much pressure can they withstand?___   

___Underwater drones can be quite expensive, and may require sophisticated domain technical expertise to operate optimally, besides when one considers huge marine research submarines they might need a parent vessel to launch them into the sea and pull them back in once their job is done underwaters. So, not really an accessible solution for everyone.___   

___Given the diversity in their sizes, operational capacities, methods used to take measurmenets etc It might be difficult standardize protocols to study different parameters, since the devised protocols need to be accomodating to a wise variety of technologies, species and environments.___   

___Under water drones/submarines have been around for a long time and is a very established method to study marine diversity in studies that have the fiscal might to afford such toolings.___   


### ___Environmental DNA (eDNA)___

___eDNA is the residual DNA left after an organism in an environment in the form of nuclear/mitochondrial DNA. DNAs by its very nature are very susceptible for degradation, be it enzymatic or microbial degradation. Shed body parts like skin, hairs, feathers will contain enough amount of DNA to identify the organism, which is a good thing.___   

___But there needs to be reference sequences to identify the species or at least find the closest species once sequencing is done. Without pre-established repositories with genome/gene sequences it can be challenging to quite pin down the species with the extracted genetic materials. So applicability of this method to a broader range of species is only limited by the availability of reference gene/genome sequences to comparae our results with, since the technique is quite straightforward and can easily be applied to samples from different species.___   

___Even though the cost of DNA extractiona and sequencing has become less expensive, the costs may become huge when dealing with a large number of samples, targetting a large number of organisms, which may require different extraction toolkits, primers and will likely incur additional sequencing expenses.___   

___Unlike underwater drones, eDNA based analyses can be standardized relatively easilty, to define a set of protocols researchers need to adhere to when conducting research based on eDNAs.___   

___DNA based identification is a very common and established technique used to identify microbes, pathogens in microbiology and pathology in addition to its applications is molecular taxonomy and the likes. However, in those arenas, a special emphasis is placed on the purity and quality of the DNA sample used in the studies. DNA extractions are carried out in sterile, laboratory conditions to prevent contaminations and degradations. Using faeces/or litters suggest we might have to entertain the possibilities for microbial degradation of the DNA in the faecal samples. There are huge chances for contamination by microbes, DNA from other animals like (insects/annelids/nematodes that consume faecal residues) ... These drawbacks must also be accounted for, when considering eDNA based studies.___
