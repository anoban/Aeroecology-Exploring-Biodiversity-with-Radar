# ___What is aeroecology?___
--------------------

- ___Aeroecology is a field of research that examines how airborne organisms interact with one another or with other abiotic components in the atmosphere.___

- ___Aeroecology is a domain with strong ties to ideas and methods encountered in ecology & biodiversity.___

- ___When we study biodiversity, we use a variety of methods that allows us to investigate different places, processes, or groups of species. e.g. Using observational methods to monitor bird populations in a given habitat, we may use light traps to attract moths in order to study the species diversity & abundance of moths in a given location, we may even use genetic profiling to identify the species of fungi found in a soil sample.___

- ___Aeroecology focuses on the species found in the air, above the heights most ecological methods operate (virtually unreachable to conventional ecological methods) and tries to investigate patterns in flying organisms like birds, insects and bats.___

- ___Methods used in aeroecology varies widely from simple binocular observations, tagging & tracking birds and bats with tags, use of technology to map presence & movement of aerial organisms. The last category is the niche into which radar aeroecology fits (hence, will be the main focus of this course).___

- ___It is vital to note that areoecology does not operate independently from land. It is intrinsically intertwined with many patterns and processes that occur at the ground level, which influence what happens in the air, how animals move through the atmosphere.___
