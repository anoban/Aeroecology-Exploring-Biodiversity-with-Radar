# ___Exploring Radar Methods___
------------------------------

- ___Different types of radars scan in different ways to produce different types of outputs.___

- ___Weather radars scan 360&deg; around the radar, at a range of elevetaions starting at low elevations (0.5&deg; above horizontal plane) and then increasing by around 1&deg; per scan, at a range of distance gates from the radar, which is around 600m in radars in the UK.___

- ___Weather radars scan volumes of air at great distances from the radar and do not detect individual objects. Instead the radar echoes give aggregate information about the group of objects.___

- ___Weather radar scans can be thought as a series of boxes arranged in concentric rings for each sweep at a given height. And the different sweep heights are stacked on top of another.___

- ___Weather radars are usable to detect objects over large areas, such as storms or migratory bird flocks.___

- ___Vertical looking radars (VLRs) take a very different approcah. Instead of scanning a large volume in low resolution, VLRs scan a single column of air often starting at 2 meters across and sround 1,500 meters high. VLRs can detect individual particles above a certain mass or size.___

- ___VLRs use a single polarization of transmission but rotate the beam and wobble slightly. The rotation & wobble (called mutation) synegistically gives information on size, shape, speed, orientation of individual objects.___

- ___VLRs have been used to quantify the number of insects flying overhead in an area, and estimates suggest it might be as many as 3.5 trillion insects per year in South England.___

- ___Halfway between the VLRs and the weather radars, there exist a variety of other designs that can capture a wider spatial volume than the VLR, while retaining some ability to detect and classify individual organisms.___

- ___These systems work similar to the other two methods, using a combination of rotation & mutation to derive information using a single polarized radiation.___

- ___Specialist radars are fiten used to detect birds approaching wind farms (farms of wind turbines), so that the turbines can be switched off to minimize the collisions.___

- ___The core radar technology is the same across all types radars, but that same technology is used in different innovative ways to collect data to address different research questions.___

- ___However, there are important trade-offs on how radars operate.___
