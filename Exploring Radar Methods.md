# ___Exploring Radar Methods___
------------------------------

- ___Different types of radars scan in different ways to produce different types of outputs.___

- ___Weather radars scan 360&deg; around the radar, at a range of elevetaions starting at low elevations (0.5&deg; above horizontal plane) and then increasing by around 1&deg; per scan, at a range of distance gates from the radar, which is around 600m in radars in the UK.___

- ___Weather radars scan volumes of air at great distances from the radar and do not detect individual objects. Instead the radar echoes give aggregate information about the group of objects.___

- ___Weather radar scans can be thought as a series of boxes arranged in concentric rings for each sweep at a given height. And the different sweep heights are stacked on top of another.___

- ___Weather radars are usable to detect objects over large areas, such as storms or migratory bird flocks.___

- ___Vertical looking radars (VLRs) take a very different approcah. Instead of scanning a large volume in low resolution, VLRs scan a single column of air often starting at 2 meters across and sround 1,500 meters high. VLRs can detect individual particles above a certain mass or size.___

- ___VLRs use a single polarization but rotate the beam and wobble slightly. The rotation & wobble (called mutation) synegistically gives information on size, shape, speed, orientation of individual objects.___

- ___If we are to quantify the number of insects flying overhead in an area, estimates suggest it might be as many as 3.5 trillion insects per year in South England.___

- ___Halfway between the VLRs and the weather radars, there exist a variety of other designs that can capture a wider spatial volume than the VLR, while retaining some ability to detect and classify individual organisms.___

- ___These systems work similar to the other two methods, using a combination of rotation & mutation to derive information using a single polarized radiation.___
