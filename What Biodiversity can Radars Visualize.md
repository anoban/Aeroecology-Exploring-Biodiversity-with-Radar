# ___What Biodiversity can Radars Visualize?___
---------------

### ___Different types of radars are capable of detecting different types of biological phenemena.___


### ___Weather radars operate over a very large spatial scales but they aren't very sensitive. They can detect groups of objects like clouds, bird flocks, insect swarms. But their resolution power is not high enough to detect the individuals.___


### ___However, the different data variables that come from geo-polarization radars can give useful information about the organisms in the volume.___

- The overall reflectivity will give insights on the mass in the air.

- A low co-polar correlation coefficient & a high differential reflectivity can help us to differentiate biodiversity from weather. This is because animals tend to be very heterogeneous, which reduces $\rho hv$. And they tend to be wider than they are tall, which is unlike raindrops, which are typically spherical.

- Further inferences can be drawn from $ZDR$ and $\rho hv$. A particularly high $ZDR$ might indicate a high abundance of organisms, as there is a greater exaggeration of differences in the horizontal reflectivity compared to the vertical reflectivity.

- These methods can be utilized to monitor migratory birds, or to detect and track the passage of swarms of insect pests.

- Smaller radars like the VLRs, bird/insect radars can be used to detect individuals. The data from such radars are useful in learning directions and speeds of movement.

- Largere animals are easier to spot as they have a larger radar cross-section that reflects the radar beam. 

- It is also possible to identify the types of individuals based on the types of their flight patterns, wing beat frequencies and body size.
