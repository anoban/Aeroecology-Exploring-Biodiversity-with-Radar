# ___Introduction To Biodiversity Methods___
----------

## ____Practical solutions to problems in measuring biodiversity.___

- ___The principal job of a biodiversity researches is to collect data from the natural environment and build a theoretical model on how these species interact with the environment and one another. There are many ways to accomplish this depending on the species and habitats we are working with.___

- ___Some of the simplest methods:___
    - Straightforward surveys on what's around you.    
        - If you are interested in large terrestrial organisms, one might use binoculars to count them.
        - Use a quadrat to count how many plants of a select species are in a given area.
        - Measuring a tree's circumference using a measuring tape.
        - Sometimes, the animals are smaller & harder to spot. And consequently the study might need a little bit more effort on the researcher's part. 
        - Using sweepnets to catch insects.
        - Vortex sampler to catch animals.
        - Beating sheet to collect animals dislodged from a log.

___&rarr; These all are active sampling techniques!___

___&rarr; There are also passive sampling techniques.___

___This involves deployment of equipments in the fields that passively collect animals/information about the animals w/o the direct presence of a human.___

- Malaise trap to collect flying insects.
- Pitfall traps to collect animals/insects crawling/walking on the ground.
- Light traps to attract insects, moths and other nocturnal animals.
- Pan traps attract pollinators.
- Aphid suction traps - tecnically vaccuum cleaners that hover 12.1 meters above the ground. At the base of these towers, the insects caught by the traps above are collected in vessels in a rotor. These rotors rotate every 24 hours, so we can get separete collections of insects in separete vessels for each day.
- Balloons / Helikites with nets attached - used to collect insects above 12 meters. A Helikite is a large van sized balloon that can be used to lift up nets higher heights.
- Kick sampling - a standard method for sampling insects in water, this uses the flow of river into which animals are disturbed by kicking the benthic sediments, and a net is placed downstream collect the disturbed animals.
- Plankton nets - that are pulled through the water to collect planktons.
- Observational surveys - in marine environments using dive transects, where a diver will follow a specific route and record the observations as they swim. However, researchers may also use quadrats and underwater drones to survey larger areas of seabed.
- Studying soil animals using Tullgren or Berlese funnels. - where a soil sample is placed into a funnel, and light and heat are applied at the top. In order to avoid the light and heat the animals will move downwards through the funnel and will finally end up in the collecting vial at the bottom.
- Studying animal populations that we rarely see - nocturnal animals / rare spcies - here indirect methods of recording are used. Using trails like scratch marks on tree barks, excreta left by them, footprints

___The techniques that have been discussed so far will give a great estimate of species abundance, diversity in a habitat. But we can use more advanced techniques to discern greater insights into the population dynamics.___

___Such techniques include regular censuses of populations, studying a given species in an ecosystem over log periods and studying the efects of certain environmental parameters on their reproductivity, for example.___

___We can also mark individuals with tags, numbered footrings, GPS collars that help to identify, locate and study an animal at its different growth phases.___

___The final set of ecological methods involve citizen scientists, this term refers to the general public, professional researchers are relatively few in number and with very limited resources,  but the general public is often willing to volunteer as a data gathering army, which ahs led to humongous amounts data being gathered in temporal and  spatial scales. E.g. UK butterfly monitoring scheme___

___The use of eDNA (environmental DNA), this is the small amount of genetic material that is left when an animal is present in an environment, like shed skin, hair, faeces etc.. The DNA in these can be used to identify the species.___

___With the advent of prolific use of computers in life-sciences, many acoustic techniques have been developed to study marine animalsd and birds using relatively low cost sensors.___

___And finally radars. This has emerged as a technology that can be used to study birds, bats and insects. However radars have been mostly used in studying migratory birds, there's incresing interest in using them to study a broader range of concepts.___
