# ___History of Radar Science___
---------------------------

- ___Radars undeniably have their origins in military tactics. In 10th July 1940, Germans launched a prolonged aerial attack on the Brithish shipping convoys in the English canal. Over time, these attcks wore down British supply lines and threatened Britain with starvation. German bombers regularly threatened London.___

- ___However, the British had a secret weapon, the radar. British radars could detect incoming German planes at a distance of 320 kilometers, and give the defending British aircrafts precise information on when and where to intercept the enemy aircrafts. The result was that a relatively small Royal Airforce managed to fight the mighty flocks of German bombers to a stalemate, over a period of 4 months in what became as the Battle of Britain.___

- ___So, how does this military tactic find its way into counting insects?. Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, who showed that radio waves (EMR with a specific wavelength) reflected off solid objects. Early developments of radar technology were kept discreet, given the nature of its use.___

- ___In 1938, there was a secrete network of 19 radars in the south of UK the Germans did not know about, that may well have won the Battle of Britain.___

- ___However, these radars were detecting a lot more than the enemy aircrafts. These include rain, snow, smoke, ground clutter, birs & insects thatmade up the noise in radar signals.___

- ___A paper published in 1945 explains that the researchers have just been given permission to report that the army was able to spot individual sea birds flying over the sea surface as early as 1941. Following the war, radar technology proliferated and found new uses. Marine radars were used to track ships, aviation radars helped to manage the boom in the airborne traffic & ground penetrating radars were used to study the structure of the land without having to dig.___

### ___For our purposes, we'll focus on weather radars.___
-----------------------

- ___After the war, surplus military radars were used to monitor the amount and location of precipitation. Results of these led to the production of radars specifically designed to detect weather patterns through 1950s - 1980s. These weather radars saved hundreds of thousands of lives across the globe by facilitating the capacity to prewarn the public about foreseen extreme weather events.___
