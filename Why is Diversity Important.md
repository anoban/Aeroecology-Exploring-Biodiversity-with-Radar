# ___Why is Diversity Important?___
-----------------

- ___The importance of quantifying the diversity organisms found in the environment.___

- ___Biodiversity manifests itself in different scales.___
    - Diversity among species.
    - Diversity within species.
    - Diversity among different habitats.
    
### ___Taxonomic diversity___
----------------

- ___Diversity between different types of organisms (inter-specific diversity).___

- ___Ecological networks function by facilitating enough interactions between species, such that their needs are met.___

- ___Having intra-specific diversity adds to the redundancy in the ecological networks. This redundancy improves the resiliency of networks and makes then less sensitive to the loss of any on particular species, since the available set of closely related infra-specific taxa can easily fill the vacated niche.___
