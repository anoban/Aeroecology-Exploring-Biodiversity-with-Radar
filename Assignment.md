## ___Studying the benefits of birds in agroecosystems with regards to pest management___
--------------------

- Birds have a negative representation in the agricultural community, often perceived as just another category of pests. Many birds species truly do cause serious crop losses, particularly in cereal and fruit crops (granivores & frugivores).

- However, insectivorous birds and raptors can be beneficial to pest management in agroecosystems. IPM strategy, introduced as an eco-friednly alternative to synthetic pesticides which often incorporates the use of biological agents like predatory/competetive insects, pathogens and parasites for pest control has failed to pay enough attention to employing birds as a pest control agent.

- The birds we are interested here are insectivorous birds like woodpeckers, kingfishers, robins and mynahs as well as large raptors like owls, eagles & kestrels. And we intend to study their impact on the pest incidence in tropical or neo-tropical agroecosystems.

- The smaller insectivorous birds feed on insects present in the agricultural fields. This can help reduce the presence of harmful pests and the large predators can help control the populations of larger pests like squirrels, rats, bats and frugivorous & granivorous birds. Consequently, reducing the damages caused by them.

- However, their impacts are not so straightforward. The insectivores that remove the pests from agroecosystems will likely remove some of the beneficial insects like pollinators, seed dispersers and insects that feed on other harmful insects. And the raptors rarely differentiate between the animals that help farmers and those that harm farmers. While removing pests like rats, squirrels and mice they might also remove beneficial animals, like birds that control pests in the fields.

- So to study how these positive and negative impacts of birds fare against one another, one needs a concrete experimental design where a plot of land has free access to birds while another hasn't. 

- However, the traditional method used to study the birds that help in pest control is to assess their stomach contents. This has many impediments associated with it. First one must find dead birds to dissect their stomachs and study the stomach contents. Else, one must find non-destructive ways to examine the bird's stomach content. This can be really challenging since this typically leaves us only one choice, that is to study the excreta. Where the partially digested contents provide little concrete evidence on the food material consumed by that bird.

- This is where radars come into play. Radars, particularly VLRs or dedicated bird radars can be used to detect the arrival and frequenting of the different bird species in agroecosystems. Since agricultural landscapes are generally free of larger trees or any other hindrances that might interfere with radar signals, we may be able to get a good grasp of the composition in the avifauna. Having identified the bird species present in the ecosystem and their abundances, we can correlate this data to the crop losses farmers face.

- A carefully and rigorously designed study plan will have protocols in place to periodically quantify the crop losses incurred by pests (losses caused by pathogens, environmental factors and cultural practices must not be accounted for). And these parameters must be measured in the test site and the control site. This can be replicated with different crop species and even a mixture of crop species as intercropping or cover cropping.

- having collcted these information, researchers can carefully isolate factors irrelevant to us, and focus on how the presence of birds affect the pest incidence in agricultural fields? What types of birds lead to less pests? How do they accomplish this? (by direct predation of the pest or by removing the predators of it's competitor species etc...). One we have the basic ideas in our hand we can fine tune our experiment design to pinpoint the impacts more precisely.

- Once we have identified and proved the benefits of a select set of bird species in farmlands, farmers can take the initiatives to invite these bird species into their fields deliberately. like bird baths, growing trees that attract such bird species etc. By inviting these types of birds, farmers can hope to reduce their pest problem in the future. Birds mediated pest management, in conjunction with other measures like natural pesticides, antagonistic microbes, pest parasites can further improve the yields and benefit farmers.
