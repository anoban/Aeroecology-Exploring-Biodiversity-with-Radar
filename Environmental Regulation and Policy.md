# ___How might aeroecology transform environmental regulation and policy?___
-------------------

## ___Focusing on temporal rather than spatial research questions and how to apply insights garnered from radar data to make recommendations to policy makers and environmental management.___

- One advantage of laboratory experiments is that they are carried out in tightly controlled environments where scientists have more/less full control over the environment. This facilitates rigorous experimental designs and promotes a good understanding of the underlying mechanisms that ochestrate the experimental outcomes.

- When we move outside the laboratory, we lose control over the environment, and we have to collect information at a much lrger scale.

- Consequently, when solutions are rolled out by policymakers, it can be incredibly challenging to evaluate their efficiency/viability in the filed!

- These problems are aggravated by the lack of support for long term monitoring, which is often critical in environmental monitoring for conservation designs that may not produce instantaneous results.

- Many interventions may even require several years of data collection to apply the intervention.

## ___Rewilding___
------------------

- A major driver of biodiversity decline is the conversion of natural landscapes to agricultural lands or cities.

- The initiatives that intend to return landscapes converted by such practices in the past to their original state is called ___Rewilding.___

- This is essentially an ecosystem restoration, where the newly recovered ecosystem is expected to support a large number of species and provide more ecosystem services.

- However, rewilding can take decades depending on the methods used and the degree to which the landscape was modified during the industrialization. And transforming large scale agricultural lands into natural ecosystems accompanies a large cost to the economy.

- Several aspects of rewilding make it appropriate for radar based studies.
    - Most rewilding projects started in the last decade, which coincides with the advances in radar infrastructure.
    
    - Rewilding projects cover huge landscapes, hwich would make monitoring difficult using conventional methods.
    
    - Rewilding requires baseline data about the landscapes being restored. But many projects tend to ignore this. Radar data can come in handy to look back in time, through historical datasets collected as part of the standard weather surveillance.
    
## ___Potential use of widespread weather radar networks in monitoring & evaluation of rewilding projects.___
----------------------

- Depending on the distribution & the types radars may not be able to cover the entire landscape intended for rewilding.

- But, they can certainly monitor the regions that fall within their scanning radius.

- Radars can help study the total insect and bird biomass in the air column, for as long as the historical data exists.

- When studying what differences that the rewilding project made, it is important to know what would have happened if the rewilding has not been carried out. For this, we can leverage ___control sites___ where no rewilding has been done that also have more/less identical  geographical, ecological and climatic conditions to our ecosystem of interest. This method of having a control site for each rewilding site is called a ___paired design.___

- One step ahead of the paired design will be the design where the data ___before and after the rewilding is collcted in both the rewilding and the control sites.___ In this way, we'll have a ___before-after, control-impact (BACI)___ experiment design.

- BACI is the gold-standard for environmental interventions, as it gives us the greatest power to detect the outcomes of an intervention. If there's a positive impact, we shouldn't see any increase in the radar-detected biodiversity before the onset of the rewilding project. And the post-rewilding radar-detected biodiversity should diverge between the control site & the rewilding site.

--------------------

- Rewilding is one viable avenue to restore human dominated landscapes. Superfluous use of pesticides has led to serious declines in global biodiversity, particularly in agrarian ecosystems. And there is an evergrowing pile evidence on the negative impacts of synthetic pesticides.

- Certain countries that had banned the use of pesticides have recently allowed their use. e.g. Brazil. To see what are the ecological consequences of reintroducing synthetic pesticides, one needs data on the effects on the agrarian systems before and after the reintroduction.

- Radar data can come for our rescue in such situations.
