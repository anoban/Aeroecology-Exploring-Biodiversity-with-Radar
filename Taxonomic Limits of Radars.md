# ___Taxonomic Limits of Radars___
-------------------

- ### ___Focusing on the extent to which radars can tell the difference between different species of birds, insects & bats.___

- ### ___Biodiversity researchers have traditionally focused on species as the main unit of biodiversity. Genetic techniques have arisen recently and ecosystem monitoring has become a more complex & challenging issue.___

- ### ___The species focused approaches likely stemmed from natural history, where scientists studied organisms in their habitats where they could be found easily. Due to this, we have developed a notion of considering the number of species and their abundance as key criteria in biodiversity research.___

- ### ___E.g. An entomologist might be interested in studying the different dragonflies in a location, their habitat, abundance & diversity.___

- ### ___The challenge comes when you start to use radars. Radars can only measure certain aspects of bioactivity, to a with a finite precision. Species of similar shapes, sizes will very likely produce very similar radar reflections, making precise inferences unlikely.___

- ### ___While the presence/absence of wings may be detected, small differences in wingspans are unlikely to be distinguished.___


### ___So, where do the morphological / taxonomical limits lie?___
--------------------------


- ### ___We still can make decent guesses of where the taxonomic limits might be based on the variables we can extract from the radar signal.___
    - We can start with differential reflectivity - a relative measure of radar beam reflection between the horizontal & vertical planes.
    - Differential reflectivity tells us about the aspect ratio of an object.
    - e.g a bumblebee typically has a circular cross-section while craneflies & praying mantis have a more flattened bodies and can consequently have a higher differential reflectivity.
    - However, these measures also depend on the orientation at which the radar gets to detect them.    
    
- ### ___In fact, the variables offered by radar signals can rarely be useful when used directly. But become very valuable when used in conjunction with indirect measurements in animal biology.___

- ### ___VLRs are capable of detecting movements with fine resolution within a small scanning volume. They can differentiate a small bird with high wingbeat frequency from a large bird with a small wingbeat frequency. This method can be used for insects as well. However, this metric of distinguishment is founded on size differences. And rarely reflects anything about taxonomy.___

- ### ___Even if we d not have information on wingbeat frequencies or sizes, we can still make inferences about the species in the radar beam in conjunction with other auxiliary information. We might not be able to differentiate a group of locusts from a group of dragonflies/grasshoppers in a weather radar scan. Since, locusts form huge and dense swarms, we can infer from both enormous reflectivity and observational reports from citizen scientists on the ground.___

- ### ___This helps detect mayflies emerging from waterbodies, flying ants emerging from nuptial flights and bats emerging from their roosts at dusk.___

- ### ___Its reasonable to assume that radars can only tell us about specific species when they occur in very large numbers which can be validated based on other data sources (ground observations).___

- ### ___Weather radars give us the lowest taxonomic resolution, and can only tell us about the differences on a scale of very higher taxonomic strata. (using their aspect ratio, biomass & abundance). In this way, we might be able to differentiate a group of butterflies from another of dragonflies or moths. But won't be able to differentiate within the groups.___

- ### ___The real strength of using radars in biodiversity studies is the measurement of biomass.___
