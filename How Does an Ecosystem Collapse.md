# ___How does an ecosystem collapse?___
--------------

___Nature is inherently complex. The effect of losing one species depends on the interactions/links that species had with other species & abiotic factors in a given ecological network.___

___Removal of one species may have little/no impact on the ecosystem dynamics or can have an avalanche effect on many other species (known as secondary extinctions). Extinction of one species triggerng a cascade of extinctions of many related links (species) is a very common pattern in ecological networks. However, it is difficult to predict this type of extinctions with accuracy.___

___Even though, the loss of most species are likely to have minimal impacts on the ecological network as a whole (owing to the complex and resilient nature of ecosystems, they can recover easily as competitor species fill up the newly vacant niches), after a threshold further loss of biodiversity can push the ecosystems off the edge and lead them to a complete collpase. In real-world networks with thousands of species and millions of interactions and connections, predictions become even more difficult and less accurate.___

___There is a non-linear relationship between the number of species an ecosystem encompasses and the integrity of that ecosystem. There are fields of ecology that are soley concerned with ecosystem resilience. These fields study how far can we push the ecosystems, until a collapse happens.___

___Conservative attempts are always made in response to an impending danger to the natural world. Mostly talked such dangers are climate change, habitat loss/fragmentation, invasive species and pollution.___
