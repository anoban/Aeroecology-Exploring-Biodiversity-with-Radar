# ___Migration Case Study___
--------------

- ___One of the major challenges in conservation biology is the conservation of migratory species across larger spatial scales. A species that stays in one place can easily be protected by protecting that one place. Migratory species, on the other hand, use an extensive network of habitatas en-route to their migratory location, which are vital to those species.___

- ___Radars can not only help identifying the stop-over sites but also can help us determine the number of individuals landing at and leaving from a specific site and what routes they take through the lanscape.___

- ___By measuring the flow of biomass of birds at each night through radar networks in USA, researchers have found that most important locations in the migratory sites where these migratory birds nest during daytime can be detected.___

- ___As birds take off at night, the radars track their flight and determines the next stop-over en-route. This methods have become more and more accurate, that they are now being used to develop models that forecast bird migrations.___

- ___This helps mitigate potential threats to migratory birds___
    - Wind mills at night, can be powered down temporarily to allow the birds to pass.
    - Urban sources of light pollution, that interferes with bird migratory behaviour.             
    


- ___This detection/forecasting systems, once connected to automated message delivery systems, can help spread awareness among the public and invite the interested groups (citizen scientists, bird watchers, etc) to take the necessary steps to observe the migration.___
